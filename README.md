# README

I made the assumption this was two separate repos due to their own distinct setup, dependencies, and execution contexts outlined in the two seperate tasks. Because of this you will find:

* **php-oop-exercise**: A PHP repo for implementing the core order-processing model using object-oriented principles.
* **vue-order-ui**: A Vue 3 repo for building a reactive frontend (with its own JS copy of the domain classes provided in the task).
